# Relationships

This is a simple program developed using ASP.NET and C#. The program basically shows how different objects interact with one another and how editing the properties of one object will effect another object.For example, deleting movies doesn't deletes director but deleting director does deletes movies.

Any change you make in the details of any of the three objects , will reflect in the properties of the rest of the objects.
